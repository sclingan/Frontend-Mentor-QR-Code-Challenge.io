## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I am learning how to make a website with semantic HTML and responsive CSS. A few things that were a challenge, centering
elements and keeping them centered for different browsers and screen sizes. Trying to keep accessibility a main concern to
ensure that all visitors to this web page are able to enjoy it!


### Useful resources
